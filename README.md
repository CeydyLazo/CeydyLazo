About
I am 22 years old. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Belize and completed a Microbiology Fellowship at the University of Florida. I have been working as a microbiologist in Belize for almost 1 year. After gaining a year works of experience,  I decide to apply to graduate school. I will be pursing a dual Masterâ€™s Degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine. I believe that I have found my calling for the biological sciences. I am very interested in topics such as in Immunopathology focusing in Hematology cancer, Gene mutation, Human Genetic Disorder and molecular medicine. I am a very curios person and like to understand how things work and why things happen.  My interest in these areas first arouse in my undergraduate studies at the University of Belize where I took Molecular Biology, that is where I found my interest for the topic. That same year my mother was diagnose with Metastatic breast cancer. As hard as it was emotionally, I found myself fascinated in understanding the cellular level of the disease.
