I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com />GitHub Star </a> based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-
Ladies/'>React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactS developers.
